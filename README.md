Lets Eat!

Lets Eat! helps you easily keep track of resturants you want to try out. Users can search a resutaurant name in the search bar, hit enter and a marker shows up on their map, and also on the list rendered below. Built to help users easily decide where they want to eat based on what neighborhood they will be in.
